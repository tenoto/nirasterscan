# Swift confirmed the position of the source within the uncertainty reported by NICER. Here is the best estimate obtained from the analysis of the UVOT snapshot:
# RA(J2000)  =  18:03:02.79 = 270.76162 deg
# DEC(J2000) = -29:49:49.7  = -29.83046 deg
# with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.61 arc sec.
